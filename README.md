# Deep Learning Models


This repository contains the implementation of many different types of Deep learning models such as FCNNs, CNNs, RCNNs, Metric Embeddings. 

# Logistic Regression

This repo contains the implementation of binary and multinomial logistic regression.

# FCNNs

This repo contains the implementation of FCNNs using numpy and followed by using Pytorch. SVM is also implemented using scikit-learn to compare the results. Finally models are evaluated using the MNIST data set.

# CNNs

This repo contains the implementation of CNNs. The implementation is performed using Pytorch MNIST and CIFAR datasets.

# RNNs

This repo contains the implementation of RNNs. It includes sentiment analysis for Stanford dataset using RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs. Bahdanau attention for sequence classification is also implemented.

# MetricEmbedding

This includes implementation of metric embedding for classification of MNIST dataset.
